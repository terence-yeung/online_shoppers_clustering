<h1 align="center">K-Means Clustering of Online Shoppers Intention</h1>

<p align="center">The following notebook details the process of building a model that is able to segment visitors of an online retail website based on their behaviour on the site. The objective of the project is to utilise clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to place visitors of the site into different groups by identifying patterns in the data collected on users of the web page. This will allow the e-commerce company to make informed decisions to increase the number of sales and revenue generated by targetting specific groups of website visitors.</p>
